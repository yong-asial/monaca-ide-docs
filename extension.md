## Example: Enabling Syntax Highlighting for Vue Files

In this example, we will enable the **"Vue - Official"** extension to enable syntax highlighting for Vue files.

By default, the IDE only provides syntax highlighting for basic file types such as **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. If you open a **Vue (`.vue`) file**, syntax highlighting will not be applied.

### Before Installing the Vue Extension

In the screenshot below, the **"App.vue"** file is opened, but the syntax is not highlighted.

### Installing the Vue Extension

To enable syntax highlighting for Vue files, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Extensions Marketplace**.
2. In the search bar, type **"Vue highlight"**.
3. A list of extensions related to Vue will appear.
4. Read the descriptions and choose an extension that provides syntax highlighting.
5. Look for an extension with **high download numbers and positive user feedback** to ensure reliability and security.

In this case, we selected **"Vue - Official"** because it is a trusted extension used by many developers.

### Activating the Extension

1. Click **"Install"** and wait for the installation to complete.
2. Reload the browser to apply the changes.
3. Reopen the Vue file to see the updated syntax highlighting.

### After Installing the Vue Extension

Now, the **Vue syntax highlighting** is properly applied.
