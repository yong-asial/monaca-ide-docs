### Moving the Previewer

The previewer can be repositioned anywhere within the editor group. For example, you can move it next to the file tab (e.g., `index.html`).

1. Click on the **"Preview"** tab.
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag it to your desired position.  
   _(In this example, we move it next to the file tab.)_

## Notes

- The previewer **displays** and **live-reloads** the preview content of your project as you modify the source code.
- If the previewer does not display content properly or encounters errors, check the **Preview Terminal** tab at the bottom of the IDE.
- The behavior of the previewer may vary depending on the project.
